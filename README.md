### Hello I'm Chris Hile.

Life is suprising and not everything falls into place at the time you want it, but when the time comes you leap at it. My wife owns a scrapbook design business and needed a website so I played around to help her out. I realized how much I loved working on the project and the next thing I knew I was enrolled at Full Sail University in their Web Design and Development degree program. I have since graduated and currently have been working on side projects while looking for my next career in particular working with javascript and the frameworks React and Next.js. I work to continually learn and grow.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on MyMovement an app for people to document and find the correlation of food, mood. meds, and bowel movements.
